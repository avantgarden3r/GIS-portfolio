Hi there! Welcome to website portfolio!

This is a website I created as a result of taking a software developer bootcamp.
It will house some GIS projects that I've created.

Currently, it uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; though I will probably update it to encompass some more programming languages
and more complex features.

Feel free to browse and contact me with any questions or comments for improvements (or approval). Enjoy!
